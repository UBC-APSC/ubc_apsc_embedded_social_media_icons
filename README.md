# UBC APSC Embedded Social Media Icons
## Purpose ##
This Drupal module modifies social media link field entries in the UBC APSC Spotlight & Rising Star webforms and provide the necessary information to turn them into icons via Twig templates.

For the Rising Stars webform, a user can enter either links or account handles (provided the platform supports handles).\
For the Spotlight form, a user can enter any amount of links (a default icon is implemented in case of an unknown platform).
## Demonstration ##
The below two social media links/handles are converted to icons of their respective platforms when the form is submitted.
